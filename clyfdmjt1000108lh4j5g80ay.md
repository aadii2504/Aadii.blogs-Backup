```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('your_table')
    .select('*');
  
  if (error) console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  else console.log('Data:', data);
}

fetchData();
```

### 5.2 Backend Integration

Supabase’s API can be consumed by your backend [as well](https://supabase.com/). For instance, y[ou can b](https://supabase.com/)uild serverless functions or API routes in your application to handle more complex logic.

    console.log('New data:', payload.new);
  })
  .subscribe();
```

### 6.3 Database Functions and Triggers

Enhance your database interactions [with fu](https://supabase.com/)nctions and triggers. For exa[mple, yo](https://supabase.com/)u can create a function to automatically update a timestamp:
