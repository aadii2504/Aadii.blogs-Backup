## 🌟 Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, 2024 has brought us an array of new tools and libraries designed to streamline our workflows and enhance our productivity. One tool, in particular, has been making waves in the developer community for its innovative approach to building type-safe APIs: **tRPC**. 🚀✨

tRPC is a TypeScript-first framework that enables you to build fully typesafe APIs without the need for a separate API layer or client-server code generation. In this blog, we'll explore the magic of tRPC, why it's becoming a favorite among developers, and how you can leverage it in your projects.

---

## 🤔 What is tRPC?

tRPC (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call) is a library that allows you to create end-to-end typesafe APIs using only TypeScript. It eliminates the need for REST or GraphQL and lets you define your API in a way that feels natural and seamless.

Imagine being able to:

* Define your API using TypeScript functions.
    
* Automatically infer types on both the server and client side.
    
* Avoid repetitive boilerplate code and focus on your core logic.
    

With tRPC, this dream becomes a reality. 🌟

## 💡 Why tRPC is a Game-Changer

### 1\. **Type Safety**

tRPC ensures that your entire codebase is type-safe. This means fewer bugs and a more robust application. Type errors are caught at compile time, making development smoother and more predictable.

### 2\. **No Code Generation**

Unlike traditional approaches that require generating client code from server definitions (or vice versa), tRPC does everything on the fly. This results in a more streamlined workflow and less overhead.

### 3\. **Simplicity and Ease of Use**

tRPC’s API is designed to be simple and intuitive. If you’re already familiar with TypeScript and React, you’ll find tRPC incredibly easy to pick up.

### 4\. **End-to-End Integration**

tRPC seamlessly integrates with popular frameworks like Next.js, ensuring a smooth developer experience from start to finish.

## 🛠️ Setting Up tRPC

Getting started with tRPC is straightforward. Here’s a quick guide to set it up in a Next.js project:

### 1\. Install Dependencies

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react @trpc/next
npm install zod
```

### 2\. Create a tRPC Router

Define your tRPC router in `pages/api/trpc/[trpc].ts`:

```typescript
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const t = initTRPC.create();

export const appRouter = t.router({
  getUser: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({ id: z.string() }))
    .query(({ input }) => {
      return { id: input.id, name: 'John Doe' };
    }),
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

### 3\. Create a tRPC Client

Set up your tRPC client in `lib/trpc.ts`:

```typescript
import { createTRPCReact } from '@trpc/react';
import type { AppRouter } from '../pages/api/trpc/[trpc]';

export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();
```

### 4\. Use tRPC in Your Components

Use tRPC hooks in your React components:

```typescript
import { trpc } from '../lib/trpc';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { data, isLoading } = trpc.useQuery(['getUser', { id: '1' }]);

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!data) return <div>No user found</div>;

  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
};
```
