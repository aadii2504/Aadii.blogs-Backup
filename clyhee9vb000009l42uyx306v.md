## 💻 NX in Action: A Real-World Example

Let's see NX in action with a simple example. We'll create a React application and a shared library within the same monorepo.

### Step 1: Create a New Application

1. **Generate a React Application**: Use the NX CLI to create a new React app.
    
    ```bash
    nx generate @nrwl/react:application myapp
    ```
    
2. **Serve the Application**: Start the development server.
    
    ```bash
    nx serve myapp
    ```
    

### Step 2: Create a Shared Library

1. **Generate a Library**: Create a shared library for reusable components.
    
    ```bash
    nx generate @nrwl/react:library shared-ui
    ```
    
2. **Use the Library**: Import and use components from the shared library in your application.
    

```javascript
// myapp/src/app/app.tsx
import { Button } from '@myworkspace/shared-ui';

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to MyApp!</h1>
    <Button>Click Me</Button>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

### Step 3: Run Tests and Build

1. **Run Tests**: Execute unit tests for the application and library.
    
    ```bash
    nx test myapp
    nx test shared-ui
    ```
    
2. **Build the Application**: Build the application for production.
    
    ```bash
    nx build myapp
    ```
