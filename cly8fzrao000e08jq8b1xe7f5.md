## 🧠 The Dawn of a New Era

Our story begins with Sarah, a passionate full-stack developer constantly searching for tools that can simplify her workflow and enhance productivity. Sarah had experimented with various frameworks over the years, but none quite captured her interest like Next.js. Introduced by Vercel, Next.js quickly gained traction due to its unique combination of server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and a seamless development experience.

## 🤔 What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React-based framework that enables developers to build fast and user-friendly web applications with ease. It extends the capabilities of React by providing features like:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** 🌐 Render pages on the server to improve performance and SEO.
    
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** 📄 Pre-render pages at build time for faster load times.
    
3. **API Routes** 🔌 Create API endpoints within your application, turning it into a full-stack solution.
    
4. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** ⚡ Update static content after the site has been built.
    
5. **Image Optimization** 🖼️ Automatically optimize images to improve performance.
    
6. **Automatic Code Splitting** 🧩 Split your code automatically to improve load times.

Sarah added a simple API endpoint to her application.

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, Next.js!' });
}
```

### 4\. **Deploying to Vercel**
