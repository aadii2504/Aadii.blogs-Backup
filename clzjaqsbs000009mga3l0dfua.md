## 🌟 Introduction

Next.js, the powerful React framework, is well-known for its capabilities to create fast and SEO-friendly web applications. One of its standout features is dynamic routing, which allows developers to create complex, nested routes effortlessly. In this blog, we'll explore the intricacies of dynamic routing in Next.js, from setting up basic dynamic routes to mastering nested routes and handling query parameters. 🌟🚀

## 🔍 What is Dynamic Routing in Next.js?

Dynamic routing in Next.js enables you to create routes that are determined at runtime rather than compile time. This means you can define routes that capture URL parameters and use them to dynamically fetch and display data. This feature is particularly useful for applications with user-generated content, such as blogs, e-commerce platforms, and dashboards. 🛠️🌐

## 🛠️ Setting Up Dynamic Routes

### Step 1: Basic Dynamic Route

To create a basic dynamic route, you need to define a file with square brackets in the `pages` directory.

**File Structure:**

```bash
pages
├── index.js
└── [id].js
```

**Example:**

```javascript
// pages/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>;
};

export default Post;
```

In this example, the `[id].js` file captures the `id` parameter from the URL and displays it on the page.

### Step 2: Nested Dynamic Routes

For more complex applications, you might need nested dynamic routes. Next.js allows you to create nested routes by nesting directories and using square brackets for dynamic segments.

**File Structure:**

```bash
pages
├── index.js
└── post
    └── [id].js
```

**Example:**

```javascript
// pages/post/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>;
};

export default Post;
```

In this setup, the URL `/post/123` will render the `pages/post/[id].js` component, displaying `Post ID: 123`.

## 🔄 Handling Query Parameters

Next.js makes it easy to handle query parameters in dynamic routes. You can access query parameters using the `useRouter` hook.

**Example:**

```javascript
// pages/post/[id].js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Post ID: {id}</h1>
      <p>Query Parameters: {JSON.stringify(router.query)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Post;
```

In this example, you can access and display all query parameters passed in the URL.
