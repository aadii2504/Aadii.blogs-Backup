## üîë Key Features

Astro offers a variety of features that make it a powerful tool for front-end development:

### Zero JavaScript by Default

Astro's unique approach is to deliver minimal JavaScript by default. This means that unless you explicitly include JavaScript, your site will be static HTML, resulting in faster load times and better performance.

### Component Agnostic

Astro allows you to use components from your favorite frameworks together in a single project. Whether you prefer React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework, Astro has you covered.

### Island Architecture

Astro introduces the concept of "islands" where JavaScript is only loaded for specific interactive parts of the page. This ensures that your site remains fast while still providing a rich user experience.

### Built-In Optimizations

Astro comes with a range of built-in optimizations, including automatic image optimization, CSS minification, and more. These features help ensure that your site performs well out of the box.

## üöÄ Building a Simple Project

Let's walk through building a simple Astro project to see these features in action.

### Step 1: Create a New Page

Create a new file in the `src/pages` directory:

```javascript
// src/pages/index.astro
---
import HelloWorld from '../components/HelloWorld.astro';
---

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Astro Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
    <HelloWorld />
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Create a Component

Create a new component in the `src/components` directory:

```javascript
// src/components/HelloWorld.astro
---
export const prerender = true;
---

<p>Hello, world! This is an Astro component.</p>
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the development server to see your site in action:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see your new Astro site!
